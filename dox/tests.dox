/**
\page Tests Tests

A test suite is provided in the `tests` directory. To run all unit tests:

\code
make test
\endcode

Note that this will compile the tests (and library) using the default compilation
flags (`release`). To build the library and tests in a specific mode, run, e.g.

\code
make devel test
\endcode

The testing framework uses a modified version of Minunit.h and Debug.h adapted from
Zed Shaw's <a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book">Learn C The Hard Way</a>.
